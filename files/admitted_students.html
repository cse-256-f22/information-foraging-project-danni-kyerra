        <h2>ORIENTATION</h2>
        <p>
            Orientation Day: This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and 
            parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This 
            visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) 
            a brief overview of what to expect during the school year. The next day, a child will attend 
            school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is 
            divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children 
            and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.
